# Jack The Bandit

This is one of multiple games we had running on multiple nation-wide TV channels in Scandinavia in the late 90's/early 21'st century.
It's now completely abandonware. Old totally-crappy code of personal sentimental value.
But hey, it ran for years without a single incident on TV. How about that!  

Graphics not included, stil lost - like this code where for over a decade!
